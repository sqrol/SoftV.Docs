# Gamepad

The **Gamepad** page is used to work with a gamepad/joystick. Here you can operate a virtual gamepad when a physical device is not connected to the computer.

When a physical joystick/gamepad is connected to the computer, the virtual gamepad acts only as an indicator and cannot be used to control the robot.
